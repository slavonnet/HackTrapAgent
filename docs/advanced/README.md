## SSH honeypot tuning

Files:

- `etc/ssh/sshd_config`
- `etc/ssh/rsyslog-sshd.conf`
- `etc/ssh/users.conf`

Important: container password is always generated dynamically at startup and is never stored as a static value in the repository.

## FTP honeypot tuning

Files:

- `etc/ftp/vsftpd.conf`
- `etc/ftp/users.conf`

Important: container password is always generated dynamically at startup and is never stored as a static value in the repository.

## TFTP honeypot tuning

Files:

- `etc/tftp/tftpd.args`

TFTP has no protocol-level authentication. The honeypot keeps the root directory read-only and uses repeated denied write attempts as fail2ban signals.

## MySQL honeypot tuning

Files:

- `etc/mysql/mariadb-hacktrap.cnf`
- `etc/mysql/users.conf`

Important: container passwords are generated dynamically at startup and are never stored as static values in the repository.

## Redis honeypot tuning

Files:

- `etc/redis/redis.conf`
- `etc/redis/users.conf`

Important: Redis ACL passwords are generated dynamically at startup and are never stored as static values in the repository.

## PostgreSQL honeypot tuning

Files:

- `etc/postgresql/postgresql.conf`
- `etc/postgresql/pg_hba.conf`
- `etc/postgresql/users.conf`

Important: container passwords are generated dynamically at startup and are never stored as static values in the repository.

## Elasticsearch honeypot tuning

Files:

- `etc/elasticsearch/users.conf`

Important: container passwords are generated dynamically at startup and are never stored as static values in the repository.

## Service toggle and ports

Use `config/services.env` as a single source of truth:

- `ENABLED_SERVICES` — comma-separated enabled honeypot services.
- `<SERVICE>_PUBLIC_PORT` — host port for each service.
